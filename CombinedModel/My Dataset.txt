Boycotting Mcdonald's and other in your own country is not going to damage anyone other than those who work in these businesses 
If the store are quiet staff will be sent home, which means they won't get paid. Thos attempted boycott will harm the lowest paid.
==============================================================================
@HilaryRuss #BoycottMcDonalds Ok. But for those of you talking about “boycott Biden”, I’m sure the president &amp; his admin. want to make sure we have an alt. source for the amount of oil we need b4 they do something drastic. If we run out of gas y’all will be the 1st ones on TikTok crying 😂
